ep_docx_html_customizer

**EXPERIMENTAL/WIP- this is not finished, and may not do what you expect! I needed this for my custom image & table plugin, but it is not yet useful as resource for those that don't have the combination of plugins I am working with. The main reasoning behind the plugin was the need to have the .docx converter process images as something other than image tags, and process docx tables in a specific way that didn't seem feasible with the existing docx conversion logic.

    Supports DOCX, DOC, ODT, and ODF file formats
    Configurable transformation rules for document elements
    Custom image processing and embedding
    Maintains compatibility with other Etherpad plugins

Configuration (TODO)
